# `grpcio` Python binary wheels for Apple Silicon

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª **GitHub Actions workflow: [.github/workflows/wheels.yml](.github/workflows/wheels.yml)**

This repo shows how to build binary wheels for the Python [`grpcio`](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/src/python/grpcio) library, for the Apple Silicon architecture.

## Motivation

Currently (version 1.48.1), `grpcio` provides compiled binary wheels only for Intel Macs, not for Apple Silicon machines.
* üëâ [check on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/grpcio/#files) if the situation changed!

Google Cloud's client libraries for Python depend on `grpcio`, and without a binary release of `grpcio` it becomes hard to install them on a local development environment.

üò∞ Not having a binary wheel for `grpcio` severely impairs the developer experience of M1/M2 Mac users: when they do `pip install grpcio`, pip downloads for them the source tarball and attempts to compile the library.

Compiling grpcio on Mac is slow, and [notoriously hard](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/25082) and, in my experience, users become frustrated after the 10th attempt with some combination of environment variables, dependencies, and compilation flags (`brew install` random stuff, `LDFLAGS`, `CFLAGS`, `GRPC_PYTHON_BUILD_SYSTEM_OPENSSL`, ...). A downloadable binary wheel would enable a much more pleasant user experience.

In [this issue](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/29262), I proposed a way to cross-compile grpcio from an Intel-based CI runner, using the amazing [cibuildwheel](https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel) tool.

This repo contains another example, that uses GitHub Actions.
